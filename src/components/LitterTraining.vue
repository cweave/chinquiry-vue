    	<h1>Litter Training Your Chinchilla</h1>
		<p>The younger you begin litter training your chinchilla, the easier they will pick it up. That all just depends on your chinchilla, though. I litter trained my chinchillas when they were both about a year old and it took a day or two for them to learn. Here’s some tips to litter train your chinchilla:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Use a medium-sized metal or ceramic pan of some sort as the litter pan.</li>
			<li>Chinchillas tend to like things placed in corners separate from each other: their food bin in one corner, their water bottle in another, and their wheel/other miscellaneous things in another. They tend to urinate away from the things they use. Find the corner where your chinchilla seems to urinating most often. Place the litter pan in that corner.</li>
			<li>Fill the litter pan with your choice of litter. Typical bedding can be used such as pine shavings. Absolutely DO NOT use cat litter or other pet store litters marketed towards small animals. Pet litter is designed to clump, and if your chins ingest the litter it can result in intestinal impaction which will result in death.</li>
			<li>Take bedding that has been urinated on from the bottom of the cage and place it in the litter pan. This will let your chinchilla know where to urinate.</li>
			<li>After cleaning the cage for the next few months, place a bit of soiled litter in their pan so they remember that is where they are supposed to urinate.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Chinchillas are intelligent, curious little critters and it shouldn’t take long for them to learn where to urinate! Just remember, just because they are trained doesn't mean they still won't default to their normal animal nature.</p>
