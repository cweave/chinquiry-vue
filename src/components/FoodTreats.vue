		<h1>A Chinchilla's Diet</h1>
		<p>A chinchilla's diet is as simple as quality pellets, fresh hay, and fresh water. With these guidelines, you'll have a healthy chinchilla. Chinchillas have sensitive stomachs, so be sure to switch your chinchilla between foods gradually over a month.</p>

		<h2>Pellets</h2>
		<p>Typically, pellet selections sold at pet stores are filled with fruits, nuts, fillers, and treats that are unhealthy and can be deadly to your chinchilla. Things to avoid in pellets include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Seeds</li>
			<li>Nuts</li>
			<li>Fruit (fresh or dried)</li>
			<li>Vegetables or vegetable products (fresh or dried)</li>
			<li>Fillers (corn, soy, etc.)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Pellets such as Oxbow Essentials (<u>not</u> the "Garden Select" version), Manna Pro Sho, Mazuri Chinchilla pellets, and Purina Rabit Chow are high-quality pellets available for your chinchilla. Typically avoid </p>

		<h3>Switching Pellets</h3>
		<p>When switching your pet's pellet, it should be done gradually over a month's time. Doing it too quickly could upset or shock their digestive track. During the 1st week, mix 25% new pellet with 75% of the old pellet. During the second week, mix 50% new pellet with 50% old pellet. During the 3rd week, mix 75% new and 25% old. By the 4th week, you should be serving 100% of the new pellet. Malnourished animals on a poor diet may likely require a cold or faster switch. If this is the case, consult with a reputable breeder or your vet before doing so.</p>

		<h2>Hay</h2>
		<p>Loose Timothy or Alfalfa hay is best suited for your chinchilla. Make sure that loose hay is always accessible for your chinchilla. Hay provides roughage that chinchillas need to aid in healthy and proper digestion. Hay cubes are also good for your chinchilla. Not only are the nutritious for them, but they are fun for them to chew.</p>

		<h2>Food Container</h2>
		<p>Chinchillas love to climb and sit on everything. If you use a food dish it can get knocked over easily, resulting in loss of food. The light weight of the food dish will result in it getting knocked over more frequently. Food bins that can be attached to the side of the cage are recommended, but ceramic bowls will suffice. A glass water bottle is recommended since chinchillas will chew on anything and everything, a plastic water bottle will not last very long.</p>

		<h2>Chinchilla Safe Treats</h2>
		<p>Chinchillas should be given very little treats. Raisins and craisins are favorites, but are high in sugar. If you give your chinchillas craisins, they should be given in very small quantities and infrequently. Try not to feed more than 3 or 4 raisins per week. Rose hips are another recommended chinchilla safe treat as they are high in vitamin C and other nutrients (check your health food store). Most commercial chinchilla treats will be too high in sugar and fats, which are best avoided. There is much conflicting advice about what sort of treats are okay; check with your vet if you are unsure about anything you are feeding your chinchilla.</p>
