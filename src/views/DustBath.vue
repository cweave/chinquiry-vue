		<h1>Chinchilla Dust Bath</h1>
		<p>Chinchilla dust bath is an absolute necessity for chinchillas. Taking a vigorous dust bath is one of their natural behaviors, and is how chinchillas keep their lush coats clean and healthy. Because of their dense fur, chinchillas are not to get wet. They will not dry all the way through and risk the chance of bacteria growing on their skin. The dust is similar to volcanic ash found in the Andes Mountains and removes dust, bacteria, and moisture from the chinchilla’s fur, keeping them soft and silky. Dust baths are thought to be relaxing and fun for chinchillas. Chinchillas tend to really get into their baths, rolling and flipping in the dust with great enthusiasm.</p>

		<h2>Dust Bath Container</h2>
		<p>A heavy, tip-resistant bowl or deep dish can be used for a chinchilla’s dust bath. It should be slightly larger than the chinchilla. Glass fish bowls, canisters, bowls, and pie tins can be used and work well. A plastic house-type container with a rounded bottom can be purchased for this purpose. Fish bowls and plastic house-type baths have the advantage of being fairly enclosed, which can help minimize the amount of dust flying around the room.</p>

		<h3>Dust Bath Frequency</h3>
		<p>Dust bath should only be made available to the chinchilla intermittently, rather than left in the cage indefinitely. Too much bathing can dry the skin, and if the dust is left in the cage, chinchillas will often sit in the bath and/or use it as a litter box. Offer the dust bath to your chinchilla at least twice a week, typically in the evening when they are getting most active. Twice a week is usually sufficient, though you can offer the bath more frequently if your chinchilla's fur starts to look rough or feels damp or oily. In humid weather, baths should be offered more frequently. Usually 10 to 15 minutes is plenty of time for a chinchilla bath. If your chinchilla has dry, flaky skin or seems itchy, decrease the bathing time and frequency a bit.</p>
