# chinquiry-vue
Rebuilt an old chinchilla information website with Vue.js and SCSS for styling. Took advantage of Vue routing for navigation and to get experience working with a single page application environment. Utilized Netlify for hands on experience with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for personal projects.
